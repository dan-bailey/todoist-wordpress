# todoist-wordpress
The original plan here was to re-use the python script I wrote and have it process the todoist data and push the results to the Wordpress REST API.  Makes a lot more sense if I just use javascript to pull the information and process it.

# next steps
* use boilerplate to create plugin framework
* set up widget framework, with settings
* get javascript pulling data from todoist
* filter, format, display data
